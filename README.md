# 📚 Gistfolio

A clean, personal, and responsive website that showcases all of my public GitHub Gists in one place — with a beautiful UI, light/dark theme toggle, and a searchable sidebar.

## ✨ Features

- 📂 Organized view of all public GitHub Gists
- 🌙 Light/Dark theme toggle with smooth fade animation
- 🔍 Sidebar with search functionality to filter Gists
- 🧭 Navigation index for quick jumping to any Gist
- 📱 Fully responsive (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- ⚡ Deployed on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/)

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repository and open `index.html` in your browser:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PranavArya37/gistfolio.git
cd gistfolio
```
You can also deploy it directly to any static hosting service like GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Pages, or Netlify.

## 🧠 How It Works

Each Gist is embedded using its `<script>` tag provided by GitHub. The sidebar index, theme toggle, and animations are handled using basic JavaScript and CSS — no frameworks involved.

In the future, dynamic fetching of Gists using the GitHub API will be added.

## 📁 Structure

```bash
gistfolio/
├── index.html        # Main HTML file
├── styles.css        # Custom styling and themes
└── assets/           # (Optional) For images or icons

```
